# Control-emulated-muscles-untiree-go2
Previous results from [Haeufle et. al. 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3182/5/1/016004) and [Wochner, Schumacher et. al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03952) already investigating the outcomes oaf using muscle actuator morphology for natural and robust movement in simulation in simulation.  
This was then implemented on hardware on the Solo-8 robot, showing more stable and robust behaviour in walking and hopping tasks by [Schumacher, Krause et. al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05371)

Building on these results, our goal is to further advance these techniques on new hardware. For that we are using the Unitreee Go-2 robotics platform.
